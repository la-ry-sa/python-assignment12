1. Reflect on the differences between static and interactive visualizations.

As the name implies, static visualizations are fixed. They just show a single plot or diagram. 
They are convenient for print outs.
Interactive visualizations are really user friendly and flexible. They allow switching between different dropdown options,
zooming in/out, moving sliders etc. Commonly used for dashboards.

2. Write a short paragraph discussing the advantages of using dashboards for real-time data exploration.

Dashboards allow real-time updates - useful for exploration. They often have filters, dropdown, time ranges etc.
They help users discover trends and/or problems, as well as make comparisons.

3. Explain how interactive tools like Plotly and Dash can improve data communication in professional settings.

Those tools let users explore data: use filters/dropdowns, move sliders, select time ranges 
They make data communication clearer and more engaging. Data is presented dynamically and in general dashboards
contain more data than any fixed plot or diagram.
